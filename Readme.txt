To run the code for this project, the main requirement in of the corpus folder 
which has all the defined inlinks and outlinks. 
I have made three sample corpus folder's.

To run the code from terminal give command:
python3 - python3 pagerank.py corpus
python2 -  python2 pagerank.py corpus

For my code I have three corpuses, so add 1,2 or 3, then command becomes:
python3 - python3 pagerank.py corpus3
python2 -  python2 pagerank.py corpus3

The above are for corpus3, for other just replace the number
